# Workman Configuration Example
# Copy this file to ~/.config/workman/config.toml and customize

# Root directory where remote repositories will be cloned

# Template for yanking worktree commands with 'y' key
# Available variables: ${repo_name}, ${branch_name}, ${worktree_path}, ${worktree_name}
# Default: "${worktree_path}"
# Example: yank_template = 'wt "${repo_name} - ${branch_name}"; cd "${worktree_path}"'
yank_template = "${worktree_path}"

# Script to execute when pressing Enter on a worktree
# Leave empty to disable. Available variables: ${worktree_path}, ${branch_name}, ${repo_name}
# Scripts are executed with 'sh -c', so you can chain commands with && or ;

# Examples:
# enter_script = "tmux split-window -h -c '${worktree_path}'"                    # tmux split
# enter_script = "open -na ghostty --args --working-directory='${worktree_path}'" # Ghostty new window
# enter_script = "osascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"d\" using command down' && sleep 0.2 && osascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to keystroke \"cd ${worktree_path}\" & return'" # Ghostty split (triggers Command+D)
